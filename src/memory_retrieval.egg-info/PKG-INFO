# crm-memory-retrieval-research

Sole purpose of this repository is to allow me to research and experiment with memory retrieval techniques for my [code review mentat](https://github.com/KamilMarzynski/code-review-mentat) project

I am using real world data for this, which means that I cannot share the data itself. However, I will share code snippets and instructions on how to replicate the experiments with your own data.
I will also document my findings here or in separate repository, which I will link to from here.
